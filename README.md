## Key Features

- **Role-Based Transactions:**  
  The platform distinguishes between users, agents, and administrators, ensuring that only authorized roles can perform specific actions such as cash-ins and money transfers.

- **Agent-Assisted Cash-In:**  
  Agents can securely initiate cash-in transactions by verifying their identity with a PIN and ensuring they have sufficient funds before transferring money to a user's account.

- **User-to-User Money Transfers:**  
  Users can send money to any registered recipient after meeting minimum transfer requirements. The system automatically applies fees (where applicable), deducts the total amount from the senderâ€™s balance, credits the recipient, and transfers fees to the admin account.

- **Real-Time Transaction Logging:**  
  Every transaction is logged with detailed information, including transaction ID, amounts, involved parties, and timestamps, ensuring complete transparency and traceability.

- **Secure, Token-Based Authentication:**  
  The application leverages token verification to maintain secure communication between the frontend and backend, protecting sensitive financial operations.

This robust system is built to offer a reliable, transparent, and efficient way to manage funds and perform transactions with confidence.
